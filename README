===== WHAT IT IS =====
SKGT Mobile Frontend for gps data about public transport in Sofia taken from
http://gps.skgt-bg.com
======================

===== REQUIREMENTS =====
require ruby (tested on 1.8.7 and as heroku deployment) and the following gems:
 - sinatra
 - json
 - nokogiri
 =======================

===== skgt.rb ====
This file is a mess, reflecting the absolutely shitty asp backend SKGT uses AND
my lack of clear vision how to structure it. It works as of now but I promise
some day I'll rewrite it.
